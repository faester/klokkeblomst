Klokkeblomst
============

'Klokkeblomst' is the Danish equivalent of Tinkerbell. In this context this mythical figure takes the problem of solving any problem in any source code as long as the problem originates from missing specs or the business inability to decide which features to include or which collaborations with external partners that should be allowed. 

To be more specific 'Klokkeblomst' will only magically solve business-related problem. If you have problems with specific algorithms, the syntax of your favorite language or any other programm-related problems, we cannot help. 

You have probably noticed that the repository is empty.
